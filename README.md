# Vagrant::Librarian (deprecated)

This gem only works with old Vagrant and Librarian versions and is 
*deprecated* in favor of 
[vagrant-librarian-chef](https://github.com/jimmycuadra/vagrant-librarian-chef).

## Description

This gem is a [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com) plugin that takes care of
installing and updating librarian-managed cookbooks as part of your normal
Vagrant workflow. This version currently only supports Chef cookbooks.
